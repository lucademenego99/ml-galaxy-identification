Bachelor's Machine Learning Course Project

## Problem statement
The objective of the project was to develop an algorithm able to identify, given an RGB image of a galaxy as input, the morphological class it belongs to. In details, we had 10 possible classes: disturbed, merging, round smooth, in-between round smooth, cigar round smooth, barred spiral, unbarred tight spiral, unbarred loose spiral, edge-on with bulge and edge-on without bulge. The dataset provided consisted of 17.736 images of size 256 Ã—256, divided in
train set (12.415 labelled examples) and test set (5.321 non-labelled examples). However, 20% of the training set has been used as validation set, and below accuracies were calculated based on it.

ResNet50 solution's score:
- Sample Wise Accuracy: 87%
- Class Wise Accuracy: 85.8%
